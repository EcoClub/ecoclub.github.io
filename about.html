    Purpose:

    We, the CHS Eco club, strive to create a more sustainable Earth for the next generation. We will organize and undertake projects to protect the environment both locally and globally, while informing the masses of the threats Earth faces and how to stop them. Believing strongly in the Native American proverb, “We do not inherit the Earth from our ancestors, we borrow it from our children,” we want to pave a path into the future to ensure every individual, animal, and plant can live on a healthier and cleaner Earth.
