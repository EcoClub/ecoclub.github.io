				We talk about the environment a lot. It is always changing: sometimes there are huge changes, sometimes, there are only
				tiny differences. We know that there are activities in effect that are bad for the environment. Deforestation, oil spillings,
				over fishing, and so much more. The only thing is, why isn't anyone doing anything about it? No matter how small or big, whether
				helping our planet is huge, whether it's picking up a candy wrapper or inventing a new source of renewable energy.
