			<p>
				We talk about the environment a lot. It is always changing: sometimes there are huge changes, sometimes, there are only
				tiny differences. We know that there are activities in effect that are bad for the environment. Deforestation, oil spillings,
				over fishing, and so much more. The only thing is, why isn't anyone doing anything about it? Our mission is to actually
				take part in doing whatever we can, small or big, to help the environment.
